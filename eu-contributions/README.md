## EU Spending, Revenue, and Net Balance by Country (2023, mn â‚¬)

EU Spending, Revenue, and Net Balance Map

The map illustrates EU spending, revenue, and net balance by country for 2023 in millions of euros.

### Data Source

This visualization is based on data from the European Commission website, specifically the report "EU spending and revenue 2021-2027" and the file "EU spending and revenue - Data 2000-2023".

### Methodology

- **Spending**: "TOTAL EXPENDITURE" row for 2023 used for individual countries and EU-27 total.
- **Revenue**: "TOTAL Own resources" row from the REVENUE section for 2023 used for individual countries and EU-27 total.
- **Net Balance**: Calculated as the difference between revenue and spending, rounded to the nearest million euros.

### Design Choices

- Color scale inspired by the chart in "Which Countries are EU Contributors and Beneficiaries?"
- Country borders sourced from Eurostat.
- Net balance gradient implemented using D3 library's gradient legend.

### Tools Used

- QGIS for map creation
- D3 library for gradient legend
